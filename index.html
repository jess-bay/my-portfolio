        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I&apos;m Jess, a recently qualified Full Stack Web Developer
          fueled by a passion for crafting digital experiences and learning
          while I do it. My journey into the world of web development began last
          year, when I had a brief intro to it and decided to roll with it due
          to pure enjoyment.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I really like about web development and have grown to appreciate
          each day, is how hands-on it is, and how much problem-solving is
          required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones - pets
          included! As a former personal trainer, I&apos;m dedicated to a
          balanced lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my academic years, I excelled through the years and finished my
          last year of high school with scholar award for achieving more than
          90%.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe continuous growth, open-mindedness, and collaboration are
          very important and that is what I will be bringing to the table as I
          kick-start my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please delve into the digital realm that is my portfolio to have a
          look at what I have achieved, where I have worked, what my skills are,
          and please feel free to use the light-dark theme button to adjust to
          your preference.
