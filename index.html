        Hello, I&apos;m Jess, a recently qualified Full Stack Web Developer
        fueled by a passion for crafting digital experiences and learning while
        I do it. My journey into the world of web development began last year,
        when I had a brief intro to it and decided to roll with it due to pure
        enjoyment.
