          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I&apos;m Jess, a recently qualified Full Stack Web Developer
            fueled by a passion for crafting digital experiences and learning
            while I do it. My journey into the world of web development began
            last year, when I had a brief intro to it and decided to roll with
            it due to pure enjoyment.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I really like about web development and have grown to
            appreciate each day, is how hands-on it is, and how much
            problem-solving is required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones - pets
            included! As a former personal trainer, I&apos;m dedicated to a
            balanced lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my academic years, I excelled through the years and finished my
            last year of high school with scholar award for achieving more than
            90%.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe continuous growth, open-mindedness, and collaboration are
            very important and that is what I will be bringing to the table as I
            kick-start my career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please delve into the digital realm that is my portfolio to have a
            look at what I have achieved, where I have worked, what my skills
            are, and please feel free to use the light-dark theme button to
            adjust to your preference.

              This is a look at my first personal project! Due to my passion for
              exercise and helping those with injuries to continue to get joy
